### How to make a contribution using the Github website {docsify-ignore}

Open a web browser and navigate to [cluster-docs](https://github.com/SIUE-ITS/cluster-docs) repo.

Start by going to the docs folder.

### Add a file.

![Github Add File](_media/website/add_file.png)

Name the file:

![Github Add File Name](_media/website/add_file_name.png)

Add content to the file editing with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):

?> A good template is the [`getting_started.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIUE-ITS/cluster-docs/main/docs/user_guides/hpc_basics/getting_started.md) file. It contains an example of almost everything with proper formatting. Do not concern yourself with formatting in major detail content matters most. The maintainers will work on this to match the rest of the site when merged.

The final step is to commit and start a pull request. Add a name to the commit, an optional description, and a branch name for the pull request. Then finally click `Propose new file`:

### Edit a file.

Edit a file by clicking the file you would like to edit (in this example the contributing page):

?> You can also go directly to the page itself such as [getting_started.md](user_guides/hpc_basics/getting_started.md) then click `Edit on git` at the top right of the page.

![Github Edit File Select](_media/website/edit_file_select.png)

Click the pencil to edit the file:

![Github Edit File](_media/website/edit_file.png)

Once you are in the file you will edit with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):

?> Do not concern yourself with formatting in major detail content matters most. The maintainers will work on this to match the rest of the site when merged.

![Github Edit File Content](_media/website/edit_file_content.png)

Once done making edits give the commit a name, optional description, and a branch name then click propose changes:

![Github Edit File Commit](_media/website/edit_file_commit.png)

### Upload images (or other files).
If your new content page or edit requires embedding images (or other files) you will want to upload the files to the `docs/_media` directory:

![Github Upload Media Directory](_media/website/upload_media_directory.png)

Now click `Add file`->`Upload Files`:

![Github Upload Media Directory](_media/website/upload_media.png)

Once in there you will start by clicking `choose your files`. This will open your file browser. Browse to the file(s). If multiple `ctrl + click` each file you'd like to upload. Give the commit a name, optional description, and new branch name. Then click `Propose changes`:

?> You will want to name the file a relevant name for ease of use in the future before uploading.
