# System Information

The following graphic depicts the SIUE ITS Cyberinfrastructure and how different systems interact with one another:

### Computing resources

SIUE's campus computing cluster consists of one login node and a total of around 512 CPU cores in around 12 compute nodes. The compute nodes have varying numbers of cores and amounts of memory, and the cluster has a few partitions to organize nodes with specific intended uses. The entire cluster resides on a 100 gigabit ethernet backbone.

For detailed information on campus's computing resources, see the [Campus Resource Overview](user_guides/resource-overview.md).

### File systems

Each user has access to three file systems for their SIUE account: `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch`.

The `/home` file system consists of personal directories of 100 GB for each user for their configuration files and personal scripts. The `/project` file system is a high-performance, parallel Ceph file system with a capacity of 100 TB of usable space and consists of directories for different research project groups. The scratch file system `/scratch` is a temporary storage directory located on every compute node which is local and **not** shared across nodes. Any files older than a week are automatically deleted. The storage space available varies between 500 GB to 1 TB.

For more information on the different file systems and their intended uses, see the [Storage File Systems user guide](user_guides/storage-file-systems/.md).

### Operating system

SIUE uses a customized distribution of the Ubuntu Operating System, built using the publicly available Debian Package Manager (APT). Ubuntu is a high-quality Linux distribution that gives SIUE complete control of its open-source software packages and is fully customized to suit advanced research computing needs, without the need for license fees.

SIUEâ€™s distribution of Ubuntu was modified for minor bug fixes and desired localized behavior. Many desktop and clustering-related packages were also added to the SIUE's Ubuntu installation.

A number of white papers, tutorials, FAQs, and other documentation on Ubuntu can be found on the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials).
