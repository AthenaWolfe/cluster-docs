# Accounts and Allocations

All SIUE students, staff, and faculty have access to the SIUE ITS Cyberinfrastructure's systems for their research projects. SIUE offers different types and sizes of computing and storage resource allocations for these projects.

### Access to SIUE systems

In order to access SIUE's systems, you must either be the Principal Investigator (PI) of a research project or an authorized member of a PI's research project.

SIUE systems are accessed using your SIUE e-ID and password, so there is no additional requirement for SIUE-specific account creation.

Note: Your SIUE e-ID is the first part of your SIUE email address (e.g., cougar@siue.edu's e-ID is cougar).

Access to and use of resources is based on participation in projects. Project setup and resource allocation requests must be made by a project's PI using the SIUE User Portal. Detailed instructions for project and resource management are available in the [SIUE User Portal user guides](user_guides/project-and-allocation-management).

For step-by-step instructions on how to log in to our HPC clusters, see the [Getting Started user guide](user_guides/getting-started).

### Principal Investigator (PI) eligibility

PhD-level researchers, which include faculty, research staff, and postdocs (but not PhD students), are eligible for PI status, which is required for project creation and allocation requests. If you're eligible for PI status, the SIUE User Portal will recognize this when you log in and you will automatically be granted PI permissions (account creation, resource requests, adding users to a project, etc.).

If you believe you're eligible for PI status but this isn't reflected in the SIUE User Portal, please submit a help ticket to the SIUE.

### Computing resource allocations

SIUE offers three types of computing resource allocations on the campus cluster: class, graduate student project, and research. For both resources, the unit of SU (System Unit) is used. One SU indicates one hour's use of a single CPU core. Computing resource allocations can be requested in the SIUE User Portal by a project's PI.

#### Class allocations

The class allocation supports academic classes with limited size and timeline. It supports up to 10,000 SUs and expires at the end of a semester. Faculty who need a class allocation should request this resource in the SIUE User Portal at least two weeks before the beginning of the semester.

#### Graduate student project (GSP) allocations

The graduate student project (GSP) allocation supports up to 100,000 SUs and is designed for students who conduct research work that is separate from a PI's main research project. A PI can create a project for a student and request a new GSP allocation for it in the SIUE User Portal. A student seeking a GSP allocation still requires their PI/advisor to create the project and request the allocation for them, as only a PI can do this.

Note: This allocation was designed for graduate students, but a PI may also create this allocation for undergraduate students that they advise.

#### Research allocations

The research allocation has three size tiers depending on the computational needs of the associated projects. The allocation usually starts in the new fiscal year, and it must be renewed annually at the end of each fiscal year to continue use of the allocation. Requests for new research allocations and renewals must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period/new fiscal year.

The table below shows a summary of the computing allocation tiers and their sizes.

Allocation Type	Size (in SUs)
Small	200,000
Medium 500,000
Large	1,000,000

### Storage resource allocations

All active projects are eligible for a storage allocation on the SIUE `/project` file system. Storage allocations are measured using disk space in gigabytes.

PIs must request storage allocations in the SIUE User Portal. When requesting a new storage allocation, the default minimum allocation size is 1000 GB per project. All users for a project will have access to that project's allocation.

If more than 1000 GB is needed, a PI can request additional storage space for free if available on the cluster. See the [storage request increase guide](user_guides/request-storage-increase.md) for how to request more storage for existing allocations.

[See the Request New Allocation user guide](user_guides/request-new-allocation) for more information.

If you have an existing storage allocation but would like to increase the amount of storage, please submit an [storage request increase](user_guides/request-storage-increase.md) for the allocation with the requested increase in number of files and/or number of gigabytes.

### Yearly renewal of allocations

The duration of computing and storage resource allocations is one year. Each year, PIs must renew their projects and associated allocations in the SIUE User Portal. Changes to allocation sizes or types can be made during this renewal. Failure to apply for a renewal will result in the deletion of all data and the space will become available for use by other users.

For more information on yearly project renewals, see the [Yearly Project Renewal user guide](user_guides/yearly-project-renewal).
