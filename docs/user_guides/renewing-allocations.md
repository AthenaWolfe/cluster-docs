# Renewing Allocations

All SIUE resource allocations expire at some point, typically a year after creation. In order to maintain access to an allocation for another year, the PI who manages the project that the allocation falls under must renew the allocation in the SIUE user portal.

### How to renew allocations

If you have already completed your [project renewal](user_guides/yearly-project-renewal.md), you can renew your allocation by clicking on the "expires in __ days" label next to the allocation, either on the user portal home page or on the Project Detail page for the project the allocation is associated with:

![Allocations Expiring Home](_media/project_and_allocation_management/allocations_expiring_home.png)

This will bring you to the Allocation Detail page, where you can again click on the yellow "expires in __ days" label:

![Allocation Expiring Detail](_media/project_and_allocation_management/allocation_expiring_detail.png)

This will show you a list of all users on the allocation and you can choose whether to keep them active, remove them from only the allocation, or remove them from your project altogether:

~!!!!ColdFront Allocation Renewal

Click the "Submit" button and your request for renewal will be sent to SIUE staff. You'll see the status change to "Renewal Requested" on the user portal home page and the Project Detail page:

~!!!!ColdFront Allocation Renew Requested

Once the renewal is approved by SIUE staff, the status will change to "Active" and the End Date displayed on the Allocation Detail page will be one year from the date of activation.

### Policies for the Campus cluster

SIUE requires PIs to review and renew their project(s) annually or access to the project will be blocked for all group members. If your project has not been renewed in a year and a campus cluster allocation for the project is expiring, you will be forced to complete the project renewal before renewing the allocation. More details on the project review can be found in the [Yearly Project Renewal user guide](user_guides/yearly-project-renewal.md).

### Policies for storage

SIUE provides each PI with up to 1 TB of storage across projects for free. 1 TB is the default minimum allocation per project. Storage allocations must be renewed each year, just like campus cluster allocations.

### What happens if the allocation expires?

If a PI does not renew an allocation by the due date, all users in the group will be blocked from running jobs on the cluster that allocation is linked to. You cannot renew an expired allocation. You must [request a new allocation](user_guides/request-new-allocation.md) for the resource and go through the approval process again if you wish to have access to the same resource.

If you have an extenuating circumstance making it impossible to renew on time, please contact us to request an extension.
