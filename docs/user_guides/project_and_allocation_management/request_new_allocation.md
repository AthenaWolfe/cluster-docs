# Request New Allocation

Once a project has been created, an allocation to a computing and/or storage resource must also be requested. Allocations indicate what resources each project has access to and any limits associated with that access. Allocations expire either by date or when a limit is reached.

### Types of allocations

SIUE has two types of allocations that can be requested in the User Portal: computing resources and storage space.

#### Computing resources

SIUE's main computing resource available to all SIUE faculty/staff and their students/collaborators. Campus is a shared resource and free to use under most circumstances.

#### Storage space

Storage space in the /project and /bulk file systems. PIs can request up to 1 TB of space across projects initially, but more can be added later if needed.

### Requesting an allocation

First, click on the name of the project that you are requesting an allocation for to be taken to that project's Project Detail page on the [user portal home page](https://coldfront.hpc.siue.edu).

To request a new allocation for a resource, click on the green Request Resource Allocation button on the Project Detail page.

You will then be taken to the Request New Allocation page:

The Resource drop-down list contains the following resource options:

- campus (Cluster): SIUE's main computing resource. Shared and typically free to use.
- project (Storage): Storage space in the /project file system. Initially 1TB is allocated to the project but more can be requested later, more information at [storage request increase guide](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/request_storage_increase.md).

Select the resource you'd like access to and provide a justification for access to that resource. Your justification should include information on how you'll be using the resource and how many CPU cores, GPUs, and storage space you anticipate needing to use.

If required, select the users on your project for which you'd like to grant access to this allocation.

Click the Submit button when done.

#### Allocation Status: New

Your allocation will now display on your Project Detail page with a status of "New".

#### Allocation Status: Active

Once verified and approved by the SIUE, the status will be changed to "Active" and you will have access to that resource for your project:

### Project Review

If you have not completed a project review in the last 365 days, you will be required to do this before requesting any allocations. You will see this error:

More information about the project review process can be found [here](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/yearly_project_renewal.md).

### Increasing an existing storage allocation

More information about requesting an increase in storage allocation can be found at the [storage request increase guide](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/request_storage_increase.md).
