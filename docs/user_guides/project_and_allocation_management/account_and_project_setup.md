# Account and Project Setup

All active SIUE members have access to SIUE resources and the user portal, but only faculty and staff members can act as Principal Investigators (PIs). In the user portal, PIs can create projects, request resource allocations for their projects, and add other users (including students) to the projects they control.

Even though a PI can log in to the user portal, they won't have access to SIUE resources by default. In order to start using SIUE resources, PIs must create a project and request a resource allocation for it. Adding users to a project is optional.

### User portal components

The user portal handles the management of 3 components: projects, allocations, and resources.

#### Resources:

- SIUE has multiple distinct resources to track
- Resources include: clusters, cluster partitions, and storage
- Some resources have limits (e.g., storage has a limit of gigabytes and number of files)

#### Allocations:

- Allocations indicate what resources you have access to and any limits associated with that access
- All SIUE resources require an allocation
- Allocations expire either by date - this information varies per allocation and is available when you log in to the user portal

#### Projects:

- All SIUE faculty & staff members can have and require at least one project for access to resources
- Each project has a description, field of research, grants, publications, and allocations to resources

### Setup overview

The following is an overview of the steps required to start using SIUE resources. For more detailed instructions, see each individual user guide linked below.

**STEP 1**: To begin, [log in to the user portal](https://coldfront.hpc.siue.edu).

**STEP 2**: Before you will be able to run jobs or get access to any of the SIUE's resources, you will need to create a project:

[Create New Project](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/create_new_project.md)

**STEP 3**: Next, you will need to request an allocation to at least one resource (cluster, storage, cluster partition, etc.). Most projects should request an allocation on the campus cluster as well as project storage:

[Request New Allocation](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/request_new_allocation.md)

If you require access to more than one resource, you can request multiple allocations. Allocation requests can take a day or longer to be approved by the ITS cyberinfrastructure team.

**STEP 4 (optional)**: You can also add users to your project/allocation to give them access to certain resources:

[Adding Users](user_guides/project_and_allocation_management/adding_users.md)

There is a delay of about 10 minutes before newly-added user accounts can access SIUE systems.

> Note: SIUE policy strictly forbids the sharing of accounts. If you have students, staff, or postdocs that are working for you, they must have their own SIUE account contact help@siue.edu for more information.
