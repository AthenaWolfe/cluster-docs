Your billing department and administrator should be for the contact who typically receives invoices and handles payments for your department, school, institute, or research group.

Once you've added billing information to your user profile, this information will be automatically populated in any resource request form that requires billing information.

> Note: SIUE typically bills departments for next year's services at the beginning of the SIUE fiscal year on July 1. It is extremely important that you have your billing information inputted correctly before the new fiscal year begins to avoid any delays in payment processing with your billing department.
